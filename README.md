# SQL Project: Career Aspiration & Employment Preferences Analysis

## Project Overview

This SQL project analyzes a dataset of respondents from India, focusing on their **career aspirations**, **education preferences**, **work-life balance**, and other factors that influence employment decisions. The dataset includes responses to a survey that explores various aspects of respondents' professional goals, such as salary expectations, career influences, and work preferences. By querying this dataset, the project answers a series of key questions to provide insights into the career priorities, preferences, and gender-based differences among respondents in India.

The main goal of this project is to:

- **Analyze career aspirations** and how these aspirations vary by **gender**.
- Identify the most important factors influencing respondents' decisions to pursue careers, including **education abroad**, **remote working preferences**, and **social impact**.
- Determine respondents' **salary expectations** and **work-life balance** priorities.
- Understand the **work frustrations** and the conditions under which respondents would be willing to work, such as their willingness to work for companies that are socially impactful or under **abusive managers**.

## Key Analysis Questions

The analysis answers several important questions derived from the survey data. These questions cover areas such as gender distribution, career aspirations, salary expectations, and work preferences.For Solution refer this:sql_project/Gen_z_assignment.sql
